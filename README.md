# WatchNow-Movie-show-website
I am proud to say that I was able to pull an entire frontend of a Movie webpage using CSS and BOOTSTRAP. it was fun and thrilling to do this project.
This project features a modern navbar with dropdowns, a trendy movie card section, a dynamic footer with icons, and a sleek dark theme. Learned tons about responsive layouting, icon integration, and design structuring. It was fun making custom made ICOn for my website and giving it a personalised touch. This project gave me a confident that I am on a right track towards my career.

ðŸŽ¬ A proud showcase of my frontend skills! Can't wait to build moreÂ likeÂ thisÂ ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
